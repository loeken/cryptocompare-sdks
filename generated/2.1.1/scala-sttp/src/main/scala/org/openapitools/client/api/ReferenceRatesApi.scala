   *   code 404 : Error (The 404 error can either be returned when some/all of parameters sent are not found within our system. This could be beacuse parameters like market, instrument, news source, symbol, asset_id etc. are invalid)

   *   code 429 : Error (The 429 error occurs when you go over the API Key limit. Rate limits are eforced on a second (resets every second), minute (resers every minute), hour (resets every hour), day (resets every day) and month (resets every month) granularity. You can upgrade your account and access higher rate limits.)
   *   code 500 : Error (The 500 error occurs our API is up but does not know how to / can't handle the request.)

   * @param groups When requesting historical entries you can fiter by specific groups of interest. To do so just pass the groups of interest into the URL as a comma separted list. If left empty it will get all data that you account is allowed to access. The groups available are: ID,OHLC,OHLC_MESSAGE,MESSAGE,VOLUME
   * @param limit The number of data points to return
   * @param toTs Returns historical data before this unix timestamp. If you want to get all the available historical data, you can use limit=2000 and keep going back in time using the to_ts param. You can then keep requesting batches using: &limit=2000&to_ts={the earliest unix timestamp received}
   * @param aggregate The number of points to aggregate for each returned value. E.g. passing 5 on a minute histo data endpoint will return data at 5 minute intervals. You are still limited to a maximum of 2000 minute points so the maximum you can get is 400 5 minutes interval entries
   * @param fill Boolean value, if set to false or 0 we will not return data points for periods with no trading activity.
   * @param mappingPriority The mapping priority of the instrument. It is set to CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST by default. It can be one of the following: CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST,CHECK_UNMAPPED_FIRST
