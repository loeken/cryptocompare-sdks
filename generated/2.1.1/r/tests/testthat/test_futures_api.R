  # @param groups array[character] When requesting historical entries you can fiter by specific groups of interest. To do so just pass the groups of interest into the URL as a comma separted list. If left empty it will get all data that you account is allowed to access. The groups available are: ID,MAPPING,OHLC,OHLC_TRADE,TRADE,VOLUME (optional)

  # @param to_ts integer Returns historical data before this unix timestamp. If you want to get all the available historical data, you can use limit=2000 and keep going back in time using the to_ts param. You can then keep requesting batches using: &limit=2000&to_ts={the earliest unix timestamp received} (optional)
  # @param aggregate integer The number of points to aggregate for each returned value. E.g. passing 5 on a minute histo data endpoint will return data at 5 minute intervals. You are still limited to a maximum of 2000 minute points so the maximum you can get is 400 5 minutes interval entries (optional)
  # @param fill character Boolean value, if set to false or 0 we will not return data points for periods with no trading activity. (optional)
  # @param mapping_priority character The mapping priority of the instrument. It is set to CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST by default. It can be one of the following: CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST,CHECK_UNMAPPED_FIRST (optional)
