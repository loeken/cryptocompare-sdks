  # @param groups array[character] When requesting all market cap historical data you can fiter by specific groups of interest. To do so just pass the groups of interest into the URL as a comma separted list. If left empty it will get all data that you account is allowed to access. The groups available are: ID,OHLC,VOLUME (optional)
  # @param limit integer The number of data points to return (optional)
  # @param to_ts integer Returns historical data before this unix timestamp. If you want to get all the available historical data, you can use limit=2000 and keep going back in time using the to_ts param. You can then keep requesting batches using: &limit=2000&to_ts={the earliest unix timestamp received} (optional)
  # @param aggregate integer The number of points to aggregate for each returned value. E.g. passing 5 on a minute histo data endpoint will return data at 5 minute intervals. You are still limited to a maximum of 2000 minute points so the maximum you can get is 400 5 minutes interval entries (optional)
  # @param fill character Boolean value, if set to false or 0 we will not return data points for periods with no trading activity. (optional)
  # @param response_format character The format of the data response in uppercase. It can be one of the following: JSON,CSV (optional)
  # @return [GENERICRESPONSE]

  # uncomment below to test the operation
