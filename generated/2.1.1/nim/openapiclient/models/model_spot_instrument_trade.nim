  CCSEQ*: int ## Our internal sequence number for this trade, this is unique per market / exchange and trading pair. Should always be increasing by 1 for each new trade we discover, not in chronological order.
  ID*: string ## The trade ID as reported by the market / exchange. If the exchange does not provide a trade ID, this will be the timestamp of the trade + a number from 0 - 999. This preserves uniqueness, assuming there would never be more than 999 trades in any given second.
  INSTRUMENT*: string ## The unmapped instrument ID as given by the exchange (e.g. BTCUSD, BTC_USD, XBT-ZUSD, BTC-USD).
  MAPPED_INSTRUMENT*: string ## The mapped instrument ID, as derived from our mapping rules. This takes the form: \"BASE-QUOTE\". Only available on instruments that have been mapped (e.g. BTC-USD).
