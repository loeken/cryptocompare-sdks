### Parameters


| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **market** | **String**| The exchange to obtain data from | |
| **instrument** | **String**| The mapped or unmapped instrument to retrieve on a specific market. We first check the instrument against the mapped list and then against the unmapped list          but you can use the mapping_priority param to check the unmapped list first. | |
| **groups** | [**List&lt;String&gt;**](String.md)| When requesting historical entries you can fiter by specific groups of interest. To do so just pass the groups of interest into the URL as a comma separted list. If left empty it will get all data that you account is allowed to access. The groups available are: ID,MAPPING,OHLC,OHLC_TRADE,TRADE,VOLUME | [optional] |
| **limit** | **Integer**| The number of data points to return | [optional] [default to 30] |
| **toTs** | **Integer**| Returns historical data before this unix timestamp. If you want to get all the available historical data, you can use limit&#x3D;2000 and keep going back in time using the to_ts param. You can then keep requesting batches using: &amp;limit&#x3D;2000&amp;to_ts&#x3D;{the earliest unix timestamp received} | [optional] |
| **aggregate** | **Integer**| The number of points to aggregate for each returned value. E.g. passing 5 on a minute histo data endpoint will return data at 5 minute intervals. You are still limited to a maximum of 2000 minute points so the maximum you can get is 400 5 minutes interval entries | [optional] [default to 1] |
| **fill** | **Boolean**| Boolean value, if set to false or 0 we will not return data points for periods with no trading activity. | [optional] [default to true] |
| **mappingPriority** | **String**| The mapping priority of the instrument. It is set to CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST by default. It can be one of the following: CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST,CHECK_UNMAPPED_FIRST | [optional] [default to CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST] [enum: CHECK_MAPPED_FIRST, CHECK_UNMAPPED_FIRST] |
| **responseFormat** | **String**| The format of the data response in uppercase. It can be one of the following: JSON,CSV | [optional] [default to JSON] [enum: JSON, CSV] |
